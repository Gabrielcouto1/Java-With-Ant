# Java-with-Ant project creator
### C program to automatically create and adjust all the files to create, compile and run a java project built with ant.

The program is made to run either in linux or windows. On both cases to compile the program, you just have to open the linux or wsl terminal and run the 'make' command. 

To run the program in linux, simply type './ant-java'. To run the program in windows, simply run the 'ant-java.exe' program.

After running and entering the name of the project without blank spaces, a folder will be created with all the directories necessary to run java with ant.


Example of how the project directory is built:
